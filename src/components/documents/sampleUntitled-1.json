Cancellation Policy: Airbnb offers several cancellation policies for hosts to choose from, which directly affect what refunds guests can expect. The types include Flexible, Moderate, and Strict, with different refund percentages based on the time of cancellation.\n\n2. Parties and Events: Parties, events, and unauthorized gatherings are generally not allowed unless explicitly permitted by the host. Violations could result in fines, penalties, and removal from Airbnb.\n\n3. Illegal Activities: Any illegal activities, such as drug use or prostitution, are strictly prohibited and may result in immediate eviction and involvement of law enforcement.\n\n4. Harassment or Discrimination: Airbnb has a zero-tolerance policy for harassment, discrimination, or abusive behavior. Violations can lead to account suspension.\n\n5. Reviews and Rating System: Guests and hosts have 14 days after the stay to leave a review. Reviews are publicly visible and contribute to both the guest and host's reputation on the platform.\n\n6.

However, it does not cover cash, securities, collectibles, rare artwork, or pets.\n\n7. Check-in and Check-out Times: The default check-in time is typically 3:00 PM, but this can vary by host. Some hosts offer flexible check-in times or early check-in for an additional fee. The standard check-out time is 11:00 AM unless otherwise stated by the host. Late check-out may be available upon request, but additional fees could apply.\n\n8. House Rules: Every host sets their own house rules, and guests are required to follow them. Common house rules include maximum number of guests, quiet hours, smoking policy, and pet policy.\n\n9. Guest Identity Verification: To ensure safety and security for both hosts and guests, Airbnb requires identity verification, including ID upload, social media connection, and photo verification in some cases.\n\n10. Extenuating Circumstances Policy: If unforeseen events occur, Airbnb offers refunds or flexible cancellation terms under its Extenuating Circumstances Policy, which covers natural disasters, serious illness or injury, and government-mandated travel restrictions.\n\n11.

    "response": "Sure, I'm here to help! You mentioned \"reservation,\" but didn't ask a specific question. Here are some details about Airbnb reservations based on the provided context:\n\n1. Cancellation Policy: Airbnb offers several cancellation policies, such as flexible, moderate, and strict, which directly affect what refunds guests can expect. These policies determine the amount of refund based on the time of cancellation before check-in.\n\n2.

Some hosts may offer flexible check-in times or early check-in for an additional fee. Late check-out may be available upon request, but additional fees could apply. Many hosts provide self-check-in options through lockboxes, keypads, or smart locks.\n\n3. Guest Identity Verification: Airbnb requires identity verification for guests, which includes ID upload, social media connection, and photo verification in some cases. This ensures safety and security for both hosts and guests.\n\n4. Extenuating Circumstances Policy: If unforeseen events occur, Airbnb offers refunds or flexible cancellation terms under its Extenuating Circumstances Policy. This covers natural disasters, serious illness or injury, and government-mandated travel restrictions. Guests must provide documentation to Airbnb to claim a refund under this policy.\n\n5. Security Deposit: Hosts may charge a security deposit, typically ranging from $100 to $1,000, depending on the listing and property type. If no damages or rule violations occur, the security deposit is refunded 48 hours after check-out. If damages are reported, the host can make a claim for part or all of the security deposit.\n\n6. Cleaning Fees: A one-time cleaning fee covers the cost of preparing the property before your stay. The amount varies based on the size of the property and its location, typically ranging from $25 to $200.\n\n7. Additional Guest Fees: Most Airbnb listings have a base price that includes a set number of guests, often 1 to 2 people. Hosts may charge additional fees for extra guests per night.\n\n8. House Rules: Every host sets their own house rules, and guests are required to follow them. Common house rules include a maximum number of guests, quiet hours, smoking policy, pet policy, and events/parties policy. Violating these rules could lead to fines, penalties, or removal from Airbnb.\n\n9. Reviews and Rating System: Guests and hosts have 14 days after the stay to leave a review. Reviews are publicly visible and contribute to both the guest and host's reputation on the platform. Guests can rate their stay on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, and hosts are also rated by the guests. These ratings affect future booking preferences and visibility.\n\n10. Host Guarantee: Airbnb provides hosts with a Host Guarantee that covers damage to their property, up to $1,000,000 USD. The Host Guarantee does not cover cash, securities, collectibles, rare artwork, or pets. Hosts must submit a claim for damages within 14 days of the guest’s check-out date or before the next guest checks in, whichever comes first.\n\nPlease let me know if you need more information or clarification on any of these points!",
